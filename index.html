            <div class="content">
                I am an aspiring Solutions Architect looking to break through into the world
                of AWS. After nearly 10 years in the accountancy industry I found and grew a passion
                in technology and seeing how automation can transform lives.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have a lot of experience getting stuck in with clients and thrive when able to talk strategy 
                and finding ways to make their requirements a reality. I am always keen to experiment and 
                find out how new technologies work, and then apply that to make the solutions I implement even 
                better. I have a proven track record of excellent customer service and want to be able to continue
                to make a positive impact to my clients.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently CCP and SAA Certified and currently studying towards the Terraform Associate
                certificate, with aims to pursue further and achieve the Security Specialty and Architect
                Professional certifications.
                <br>
                <br>
                In my spare time you can find me either watching various motorsport such as
                Formula 1, Formula E and Indycar amongst others, or working on my homelab and learning more
                about Linux and the FOSS ecosystem, of which I use Manjaro Linux as my primary OS.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am confident that I would become a valued member of your team and hope that you will consider
                me for your next Solutions Architect or DevOps role.
