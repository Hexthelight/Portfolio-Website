            <div class="content">
                Infrastructure as Code is one of the biggest benefits of being in the cloud 
                and understanding how it works is a vital part of being a DevOps engineer 
                and Solutions Architect so it was definitely a skillset that I wanted to have 
                in my repertoire.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a result I wanted to create a basic template using both CloudFormation and
                Terraform to demo the capabilities of the two platforms and identify which
                I prefer and the use cases for each.
                <br>
                <br>
                Both of my templates will create using the EU-West-3 region a new VPC, along with 
                all of the necessary networking including multiple public subnets across 2 AZ's,
                and an Application Load Balancer which routes traffic to a target group
                powered by an Auto Scaling Group containing a basic web server AMI.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">CloudFormation</div>
            <div class="content">
                For my first template I used YAML as my initial language 
                of choice mainly down to its readability. I have had experience with JSON in the
                past when it comes to permissions in AWS such as IAM and S3 Bucket Policies but
                I've always found it a bit too hard to read and fiddly with all of the brackets
                flying around everywhere.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is actually my first experience with YAML having run across it 2 or 3 times
                in the past, and have actually found using it very straightforward. I never ran
                into any breaking syntax issues, apart from when I may have used the wrong type,
                where I entered the item as a string when it should have been entered as a list
                even with only one item etc.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of my tests in the near future is to replicate this file in JSON so I can get
                better acquainted with how that works especially as it has a much wider use case 
                and would be the prominent solution when looking to automating these templates
                further.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Terraform</div>
            <div class="content">
                My initial experience with Terraform was by following the basic "getting started 
                with AWS" and so this template very much came as trial by fire from very little
                knowledge on how Terraform worked in a more practical use case. I learnt this the 
                hard way whilst doing more research and wound up on the Terraform registry, which
                I noted allowed for a much more compact way of creating such as the VPC element
                which also created the Internet Gateway, Route Tables, Subnets etc. It wasn't
                until I tested an EC2 instance that I realised that what I was using were modules,
                not resources!
                
                I kept these for the basic elements but used the generic resources for the Load
                Balancer and Auto Scaling Group as the documentation felt easier to follow and
                learn from the documentation.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Security Groups</div>
            <div class="content">
                Creating the security groups actually proved a bit of an unknown challenge. In my
                first running of the Terraform template I initially did not include any egress
                rules, purely ingress rules. This was due to my experience with the AWS Console
                where the default position with the outbound rules is to automatically allow all 
                outbound traffic, however with Terraform this is not the case. This led to a fault
                once the Terraform stack was created that the instances would be created under the
                ASG and you could connect to the web servers under the individual instances' public
                IP address, however it would fail all of the ELB health checks due to a time out.
                <br>
                <br>
                Initiall I played around with the health check settings to increase the interval to
                prevent any time out but to no avail. I then realised that if I could connect to the
                instance directly, but the target group was not receiving any updates from said 
                instances, then it must be due to something going wrong in the middle. I then checked
                the security group to make sure that the EC2 instances were allowed to send a response 
                and found that the egress rules were empty. Upon adding the egress rule on the security 
                group template the target group sprung into life and everything worked from that point 
                onwards!
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">CloudFormation vs Terraform</div>
            <div class="content">
                Throughout my learning, I found Terraform the better service to use from a creation
                standpoint, mainly down to the fact that you have tools like validate and plan which 
                provide that safety buffer that you know your code is going to apply successfully 
                before you press go. The syntax felt a bit safer as well as it was common feedback
                during my research and speaking with those more familiar that it is easier to make 
                a mistake with YAML compared to JSON and so I wanted to make sure I wasn't inadvertently
                making any fundamental flaws in my syntax.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, I did find the CloudFormation documentation much clearer, and it was a bit
                more difficult to jump down the proverbial rabbit hole compared to Terraform, even 
                at the cost of not being able to do things like recording outputs like I've demo'd 
                in my Terraform code.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Cost</div>
            <div class="content">
                The good thing about these templates is that I have been able to successfully test 
                both CloudFormation and Terraform completely free of charge, as all of the resources 
                that I have created fall under the free tier using t2.micro instances. This has given
                me a safe place to demo the capabilities of the two services without incurring any cost,
                even whilst troubleshooting such as with the Security Group issues mentioned above.
