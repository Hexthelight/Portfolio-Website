            <div class="sub-heading">The Goal</div>
            <div class="content">
                Having used Linux as my daily operating system for about 2 years now, I have
                really gained an appreciation for open source software, especiall software that 
                you can host yourself. This has led me on a seemingly never-ending search to 
                find the best open source alternatives to my typical day-to-day applications. 
                One such example is Diagrams.net, formerly Draw.io. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As an aspiring Solutions Architect using an architecting and flow chart tool 
                like Diagrams is an absolute must-have, especially as Diagrams has a massive 
                section dedicated purely to the various AWS, GCP and Azure services amongst 
                others, which makes architecting so much easier to design. I was super excited when I then
                heard that Diagrams is in fact open source and self-hostable and I knew that I just
                had to try and host it myself using AWS.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Why Self-host?</div>
            <div class="content">
                Self hosting provides a lot of benefits, the primary one being security. If you 
                are self-hosting an application that stores or utilises sensitive or mission-critical 
                data being able to self-host data allows greater control in terms of being able to limit
                access to these application and being able to monitor the app's usage muhc better than if you were
                using a closed-source SAAS application.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Diagrams.net is a fairly straightforward application it doesn't really benefit from the privacy
                and security that self-hosting provides, as it doesn't have any ability to store any of the 
                created diagrams within the paplication, instead they are saved locally to the device that is accessing 
                the application.
                Instead the real benefit of self-hosting Diagrams.netis to keep the access within your AWS network, meaning
                that you don't have to traverse the public internet to access your key applications.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Building with Docker Compose</div>
            <div class="content">
                Downloading the Diagrams.net self-hosting package gives you access to multiple docker files depending
                on the platform you are hosting for such as nextcloud. This also contains a docker-compose file 
                which can create a blueprint for the docker file in AWS including building the necessary infrastructure to allow 
                for the proper working of the application.
                <br>
                <br>
                Using Docker Compose it will automatically create the ECS tasks using Fargate, and attach it to a network 
                load balancer with the necessary ports opened in the security group etc. meaning it is a really simple 
                setup in that you just need to build the compose file and everything else is managed for you.
                <br>
                <br>
                In order to get it working easily online I did also open up port 80 and 443 in the security group and 
                network load balancer as teh app defaulted to port 8080 and 8443 respectively.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Self-signing certificates</div>
            <div class="content">
                Because the docker files already build in elements for self signing certificates 
                via Let's Encrypt! it has caused some weird issues when trying to build access to
                the page through my Route 53 domain using the certificates issued by ACM, in that 
                the self-signing certificate seems to override the ACM certificate and therefore 
                causes a few warning messages when accessing the webpage via HTTPS. This is something 
                I haven't quite been able to resolve as of yet but want to look into further.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Scheduled Scaling using Lambda and Eventbridge</div>
            <div class="content">
                Because this setup isn't really able to make use of any free tier benefits I 
                wanted to try and minimise costs by only having the tasks running only when I 
                would be using it. As Fargate doesn't have a way of being able to do scheduled 
                scaling events I was able ot replicate this functionality using a mixture of 
                Lambda and EventBridge.
                <br>
                <br>
                Using EventBridge I can set a Lambda function to trigger on a set schedule using a 
                cron job to determine when these triggers should fire every day. This then trigger 
                the Lambda function that will change the task count based on the JSON code supplied 
                by the EventBridge rule.
            </div>
            <img src="../images/projects/diagrams.net/Lambda function.png" alt="" class="supporting-image">
            <div class="content">
                As a result, I have 2 EventBridge rules, one to "start" Diagrams every morning 
                and one to "Stop" it every evening.
            </div>
            <img src="../images/projects/diagrams.net/List of Eventbridge rules.png" alt="" class="supporting-image">
            <div class="content">
                Each rule then triggers the Lambda function 3 times, once for each task that is part 
                of the Diagrams ECS cluster.
                <br>
                <br>
                This then provides a JSON file that identifies the task that we want to define 
                and then whether the status is "start" or "stop" to change the task count accordingly.
            </div>
            <img src="../images/projects/diagrams.net/ECS Start JSON.png" alt="" class="supporting-image">
            <div class="content">
                By having a generic Lambda function and then passing in the relevant variables into the
                JSON file it makes the functions much more flexible and easier to manage.
            </div>
            <div class="sub-heading">Cost</div>
            <div class="content">
                This project has actually worked out to be more expensive than I originally 
                anticipated, due to the sort of resources that the docker compose file was 
                utilizing. For example, by using a network load balancer as opposed to an application 
                load balancer, I was not able to employ the free tier that is available 
                just for ALB's, and so I was having to pay for the full amount of time that the NLB was running.
                This is a similar situaiton with Fargate, in that I would need to pay essentially per 
                hour that the tasks were running. The scheduled scaling did a good job of reducing my ECS 
                costs however unfortunately that could not do anything for the network load balancer so the costs
                did remain fairly high at around £40 per month.
                <br>
                <br>
                This could be mitigated by moving to ECS hosted on EC2 using a free tier instance such as the T2.micro 
                and employing an ALB however that would require much more hands on experience to set up which 
                I am currently not too confident with as my experience with Docker is still fairly limited.
                I hope to be able to improve this with further projects and perhaps come back and 
                replicate this project with an emphasis on reducing cost as much as possible.
