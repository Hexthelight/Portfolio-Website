            <div class="content">After nearly 10 years in the accounting profession I have found a passion for technology
                and seeing how it can transform lives through automation, which has led me to want to shift focus from the 
                numbers and to be able to support those who can build those transformative systems by implementing the 
                infrastructure and services to be able to make that happen. I am at my best when able to talk strategy and
                understanding client's requirements but still maintain an excellent level of detail to create the best
                solution for the client.
